  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Novel epidemiology models are required to link
              correlated variables over time, especially haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
              and body mass index (BMI) for diabetes prevention policy analysis.
              This article develops an epidemiology model to correlate metabolic
              risk factor trajectories. METHOD: BMI, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h
              glucose, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and
              high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were analysed over 16
              years from 8150 participants of the Whitehall II prospective
              cohort study. Latent growth curve modelling was employed to
              simultaneously estimate trajectories for multiple metabolic risk
              factors allowing for variation between individuals. A simulation
              model compared simulated outcomes with the observed data. RESULTS:
              The model identified that the change in BMI was associated with
              changes in glycaemia, total cholesterol and systolic blood
              pressure. The statistical analysis quantified associations among
              the longitudinal risk factor trajectories. Growth in latent
              glycaemia was positively correlated with systolic blood pressure
              and negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol. The
              goodness-of-fit analysis indicates reasonable fit to the data.
              CONCLUSIONS: This is the first statistical model that estimates
              trajectories of metabolic risk factors simultaneously for diabetes
              to predict joint correlated risk factor trajectories. This can
              inform comparisons of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
              preventive interventions, which aim to modify metabolic risk
              factors.",

               This class includes and extends a number of specific models which
               have been proposed recently, and, in the absence of association,
               reduces to separate models for the measurements and events based,
               respectively, on a normal linear model with correlated errors and
               a semi-parametric proportional hazards or intensity model with
               frailty. Special cases of the model class are discussed in detail

               tool in the development of public policies. In this article, we
               use microsimulation to evaluate policies for prostate cancer
               testing. We implemented the microsimulations as an R package,
               with pre- and post-processing in R and with the simulations
               written in C++. Calibrating a microsimulation model with a large
               population can be computationally expensive. To address this
               issue, we investigated four forms of parallelism: (i) shared
               memory parallelism using R; (ii) shared memory parallelism using
               OpenMP at the C++ level; (iii) distributed memory parallelism
               using R; and (iv) a hybrid shared/distributed memory parallelism
               using OpenMP at the C++ level and MPI at the R level. The close
               coupling between R and C++ offered advantages for ease of
               software dissemination and the use of high-level R
               parallelisation methods. However, this combination brought
               challenges when trying to use shared memory parallelism at the
               C++ level: the performance gained by hybrid OpenMP/MPI came at
               the cost of significant re-factoring of the existing code. As a
               case study, we implemented a prostate cancer model in the
               microsimulation package. We used this model to investigate
               whether prostate cancer testing with specific re-testing
               protocols would reduce harms and maintain any mortality benefit
               from prostate-specific antigen testing. We showed that
               four-yearly testing would have a comparable effectiveness and a
               marked decrease in costs compared with two-yearly testing and
               current testing. In summary, we developed a microsimulation
               package in R and assessed the cost-effectiveness of prostate
               cancer testing. We were able to scale up the microsimulations
               using a combination of R and C++, however care was required when
               using shared memory parallelism at the C++ level.",

              It has the capacity to perform microsimulation models more

               state-transition models (cSTMs) in R, where the state transition
               probabilities were constant over time. However, in practice, many
               cSTMs require transitions, rewards, or both to vary over time
               (time dependent). This tutorial illustrates adding 2 types of
               time dependence using a previously published cost-effectiveness
               analysis of multiple strategies as an example. The first is
               simulation-time dependence, which allows for the transition
               probabilities to vary as a function of time as measured since the
               start of the simulation (e.g., varying probability of death as
               the cohort ages). The second is state-residence time dependence,
               allowing for history by tracking the time spent in any particular
               health state using tunnel states. We use these time-dependent
               cSTMs to conduct cost-effectiveness and probabilistic sensitivity

               interest from the outputs generated from the cSTM, such as
               survival probability and disease prevalence, often used for model
               calibration and validation. We present the mathematical notation
               first, followed by the R code to execute the calculations. The
