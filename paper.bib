  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Novel epidemiology models are required to link
              correlated variables over time, especially haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
              and body mass index (BMI) for diabetes prevention policy analysis.
              This article develops an epidemiology model to correlate metabolic
              risk factor trajectories. METHOD: BMI, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h
              glucose, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and
              high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were analysed over 16
              years from 8150 participants of the Whitehall II prospective
              cohort study. Latent growth curve modelling was employed to
              simultaneously estimate trajectories for multiple metabolic risk
              factors allowing for variation between individuals. A simulation
              model compared simulated outcomes with the observed data. RESULTS:
              The model identified that the change in BMI was associated with
              changes in glycaemia, total cholesterol and systolic blood
              pressure. The statistical analysis quantified associations among
              the longitudinal risk factor trajectories. Growth in latent
              glycaemia was positively correlated with systolic blood pressure
              and negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol. The
              goodness-of-fit analysis indicates reasonable fit to the data.
              CONCLUSIONS: This is the first statistical model that estimates
              trajectories of metabolic risk factors simultaneously for diabetes
              to predict joint correlated risk factor trajectories. This can
              inform comparisons of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
              preventive interventions, which aim to modify metabolic risk
              factors.",

               of a sequence of longitudinal measurements and an associated
               sequence of event times, including single-event survival data.
               This class includes and extends a number of specific models which
               have been proposed recently, and, in the absence of association,
               reduces to separate models for the measurements and events based,
               respectively, on a normal linear model with correlated errors and
               a semi-parametric proportional hazards or intensity model with
               frailty. Special cases of the model class are discussed in detail
               and an estimation procedure which allows the two components to be
               linked through a latent stochastic process is described. Methods
               are illustrated using results from a clinical trial into the
               treatment of schizophrenia.",
